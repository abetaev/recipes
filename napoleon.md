| ingredient | amount | unit | comment
|------------|--------|------|---------
| **yolk**   | 1      | ct   | $$$
| milk       | 200    | ml   |
| sugar      | 40     | g    | ~2 tbsp

| vanilla    | ~0.2   | tsp  | by taste


preparation
-----------

1. mix: yolk, sugar and flour to homogeneous white consistency
   - adding small (1/8) amount of milk may ease the process
2. heat up milk up to 60-70℃
3. add mix into hot milk
4. continue slowly heating final mix constantly stirring
5. keep ~85℃ stirring until thickening

### proportions

| ingredient    | amount  | unit | comment
|---------------|---------|------|---------
| **egg white** | 1       | ct   | $$
| flour         | 240-260 | g    | adjusts hardness, the harder the better, hard requires a lot of physical effort
| butter        | 100     | g    |
| water         | 60      | ml   |
| vinegar       | 0.5     | tsp  | acid is needed to make dough flexible, can be replaced with appropriate amount of lemon juice
| salt          | 1/8     | tsp  | pinch

### preparation

1. mix whites, **cold** water, vinegar and salt
2. grate frozen (for convenience) butter
3. add flour to butter and mix until more-or-less homogeneous
4. create crater in the middle and add mix(1) into it
5. mix until dough stops sticking to hands
6. wrap into plastic or foil and put into fridge for 4-12h

baking
------

1. form a cylinder
2. split onto equal 120-160g pieces
   - size depends on radius of stencil (dish)
3. roll each piece with rolling pin
   - ideally the result should be very thin, almost transparent
   - it's better to roll it on foil or baking sheet to avoid tearing during transportation
4. use stencil (dish) to cut proper circle out of the rolled dough
   - put cuttings aside
5. use fork to make small holes in layer to avoid excess bubbling
6. bake until golden-brown (by taste)

   in my current oven:
   - 10-12 min 360F (180C)
   - 8-10 min 380F (195C)

7. lay down cuttings on baking sheet and bake them until golden-brown, same way as with layers

assembly
========

proportions
-----------

2 yolks per 1 egg white (50% egg whites are wasted)

sizes
-----

base ingredient: egg yolk

| amount | size qualifier |
|--------|----------------|
| 4      | small          |
| 6      | medium         |
| 8      | large          |
| 10     | extra large    |

process
-------

1. put the thickest layer on the bottom with flat side down (the opposite side to one on which it was baked)
2. spread custard all over the layer so that it covers it evenly and thoroughly (don't forget edges!)
3. put next layer flat side up
3. spread custard same way as in pt.2
4. repeat from pt.1 until layers are exhausted
5. crush baked cuttings into crumbs and sprinkle all over (sides and and edges as well!!!)
6. cover to avoid air exchange and put into fridge for at least 12 hours
   - the more it stays the better it gets; the best taste will be in 36-48 hours after assembly, further waiting is not
     worth it
